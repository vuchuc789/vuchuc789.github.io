## Set up

To start, we run a Nginx pod and set its request and limit to 1 core of CPU. Here is the pod's manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
    - image: nginx:1.27
      name: nginx
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 1
        limits:
          cpu: 1
```
