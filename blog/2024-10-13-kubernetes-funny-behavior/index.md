> In this blog, I will discuss a scenario I encountered regularly when working with Kubernetes. It may require you to have some basic knowledge of Kubernetes.

<!-- truncate -->

To start with, we run a Nginx pod and set its request and limit to 1 core of CPU. Here is the pod's manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
    - image: nginx:1.27
      name: nginx
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 1
        limits:
          cpu: 1
```

Once the pod is ready, we can check the logs of this pod, and here is the result:

```

```

As we can see, there are so many workers created. If you don't know, Nginx configures its default number of workers equal to the number of CPU cores. However, we have configured the pod's CPU limit to 1. Why are there so many Nginx workers created? Are the number of workers and the CPU limit related together?

The answer is that they are different terminologies. While the number of CPU cores is the number of the host machine, the CPU limit value is the amount of time that containers can use CPU in a period of time. To be specific, I ran the Nginx pod in a Kubernetes that has 80 CPU cores, which means there are 80 workers created as the default configuration of Nginx. Let's run the `lscpu` command in the pod's shell to see more about what happened to the CPU in a pod.

You may see the above specification belongs to the host machine, and it shows that the CPU has 80 cores. Consequently, pods will use the CPU specification of the node for its runtime. This behavior will also happen to any arbitrary Docker containers, but you may see it less bizarre as containers running in Kubernetes.

Now we can dig deeper into what the CPU limit actually is. As I mentioned above, it is the amount of time that containers can use in a period. In Kubernetes, CPU usage is managed by time-slicing via the CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) in the underlying Linux kernel. The CFS ensures that every container gets a fair share of the CPU within fixed time windows, or periods. For example, my node has 80 cores with the CFS period being 100ms, which means there are `80 cores * 100ms = 8000ms` of CPU available time per 100ms period for pods' usage (keep in mind that CPU can handle instructions simultaneously, so 8000ms per 100ms period is feasible). The Nginx pod is set CPU limit to `1 = 1 vCPU = 1 / 80 * 8000ms = 100ms`, so if the CPU usage in a period exceeds 100ms, the CFS will throttle the pod, meaning it wonâ€™t allow the container to use more CPU until the next period starts. 

In summary, the number of CPU cores and the CPU limit should be kindly distinguished. In addition to Nginx, you may encounter this phenomenon in some other applications, like the Jest testing library in Javascript and the testing package in Golang. If the number of spawned workers is not configured properly, pods will cause CPU throttling and will be terminated if health probes are configured.
